## Project Scenario

We are a consulting group with high knowledge of the automotive industry. A company from China wants to assess the market to introduce some products. Our objective is to provide market conclusions to the company so they can launch their products with a better understanding of the automotive market in Mexico.

## Main Questions

- How has the market evolved in terms of the volume of vehicles sold?
- Which brand has dominance in the market, and in which segments are they involved?
- Has the market composition over time seen the main brands lose control, or have they maintained it?
- What are the most sold models in Mexico?
- Which segments are more relevant, and how has this changed over time?
- How much of the market is locally produced versus imported?
- How has sourcing changed over time?

- `summary.ppt`: Presentation with graphs and findings.

## Data
The data is published by INEGI for the automotive market in Mexico (sales from 2005 to date). The team decided to focus on data up to 2023 to avoid forecasting or creating speculative data for incomplete years. The data was obtained via a direct online connection to the file, so there was no need to download it. We grouped or filtered the data based on the needs of the graphs and the questions we intended to answer.

## Python Libraries
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Pandas
- Scipy.stats
- Numpy
- Matplotlib.ticker
- Seaborn

## Working Process
The team used GitHub branches, projects, and actions. Each participant was assigned specific questions and tasks depending on their progress and availability. Files were shared via OneDrive for the presentation and collaborative work.

## Main Obstacles
The project initially used a collaborative process via GitHub with projects, pull requests, and branches. However, some issues arose due to lack of experience, requiring a shift to a file-sharing approach to complete the project. With the help of the professor, the team quickly resolved the issues. Proposals such as using VS Code collaboration and sharing Jupyter Notebook cells were considered. One person gathered everything and then uploaded it to maintain control of the file. Subsequent changes had to be directly uploaded to the file, as most participants had completed their tasks.
